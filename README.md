# quickbms
Files extractor and reimporter, archives and file formats parser, advanced tool for reverse engineers and power users, and much more.

You should fetch the tools and bms script from their original location at: http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm

Just hosting them here in case that disappears, as well as to have all the tools in one place, but be aware the ones here may be old or out of date.
